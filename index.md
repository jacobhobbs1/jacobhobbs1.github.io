I am a fourth-year PhD student at [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk), Newcastle University, researching the impact of augmented reality (AR) on medical imaging workflows. My work explores how AR can be integrated with existing technologies to enhance efficiency, support clinical decision-making, and improve medical training. In the first year of my PhD, I interviewed surgeons and radiologists across the North East to understand current practices and identify opportunities for meaningful AR integration. The paper detailing this study was published in the [JMIR XR](https://xr.jmir.org/2025/1/e68810/) and Spatial Computing journal in August 2025. Since then, I have expanded this research to include both clinical applications and training contexts, running interviews and workshops with stakeholders to uncover technological limitations and opportunities for adoption.

To support this, I conducted a scoping literature review inspired by the needs of medical applications, particularly the perceptual challenges of head-mounted displays. While motivated by healthcare, the insights from this review extend well beyond medicine, offering guidance for the design and integration of AR across a range of fields. This review was published in the [MDPI Informatics](https://www.mdpi.com/3431204) journal in August 2025.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Newcastle University, where my final dissertation focused on the development process of digital twins, including the development of a digital twin of an F1Tenth car as a case study. Before starting my PhD, I completed a summer placement with the [EPiC (Educational Practices in Computing)](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/groups/epic/) research group, where I developed a [command-line interface simulator](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/Command-Line-Interface-Sim/) to support student learning in a safe, interactive environment. This experience allowed me to deepen my knowledge of interface design, command-line systems, and project management.
