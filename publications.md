### Designs and Interactions for Near-Field Augmented Reality: A Scoping Review
**Abstract** <br>
Augmented reality (AR), which overlays digital content within the user’s view, is gaining traction across domains such as education, healthcare, manufacturing, and entertainment. The hardware constraints of commercially available HMDs are well acknowledged, but little work addresses what design or interactions techniques developers can employ or build into experiences to work around these limitations. We conducted a scoping literature review, with the aim of mapping the current landscape of design principles and interaction techniques employed in near-field AR environments. We searched for literature published between 2016 and 2025 across major databases, including the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included if they explicitly employed design or interaction techniques with a commercially available HMD for near-field AR experiences. A total of 780 articles were returned by the search, but just 7 articles met the inclusion criteria. Our review identifies key themes around how existing techniques are employed and the two competing goals of AR experiences, and we highlight the importance of embodiment in interaction efficacy. We present directions for future research based on and justified by our review. The findings offer a comprehensive overview for researchers, designers, and developers aiming to create more intuitive, effective, and context-aware near-field AR experiences. This review also provides a foundation for future research by outlining underexplored areas and recommending research directions for near-field AR interaction design.

### Role of Augmented Reality in Tertiary Care: Qualitative Investigation Using Thematic Analysis
**Background:** <br>
While augmented reality (AR) as a concept is not new, it is still an emerging technology with a wide range of applications that it could provide value for. In the medical field, AR is becoming ever more prevalent, but while it has been applied to various medical tasks, it is far from commonplace. Radiological imaging has been suggested as one of these applications, and the radiology workflow capacity crisis the United Kingdom’s National Health Service is experiencing is a potential opportunity for technology to alleviate pressure. Understanding clinical stakeholders and current systems is important for identifying design opportunities for developing AR to enhance interactions and gain more from radiological images. <br>
**Objective:** <br>
This study had 3 key aims. First, to build an understanding of the field in the context of AR; second, to understand the stakeholders and workflows surrounding radiological images; and finally, to suggest how AR could integrate within these workflows and current practices in order to provide value. <br>
**Methods:** <br>
We conducted 14 interviews with hospital-based consultants in a range of specialties and then completed a thematic analysis on the transcripts in order to find trends that suggest what value AR could add to radiological imaging, where that value could be added, and who would benefit. We implemented reflexive thematic analysis to develop themes from across the interviews, which were then built on to suggest design implications. <br>
**Results:** <br>
We find that the need for efficiency in image evaluation is present across many roles, regardless of the clinical question, but consultants can be resistant to new technology. Additionally, we find that the current capability of AR technology could be of greater benefit to radiologists as opposed to surgeons or other practitioners. We discuss these findings for the development of AR applications and present 3 design implications that stand as our core contribution. <br>
**Conclusions:** <br>
We conclude with 3 design implications for the application of AR within radiological imaging based on the results of our thematic analysis and frame them within the Human-Computer Interaction and medical fields. The first design implication highlights efficiency and how AR has the potential to allow for quicker comprehension and measurements. Second, we suggest that the capability of AR tools should complement existing techniques and not simply replicate current ability in 3 dimensions. Finally, the integration of AR tools with existing workflows is crucial in the uptake of the technology in order not to negatively disrupt practice. <br>
