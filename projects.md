# Projects and Repositories

This page contains a collection of projects and Github repositories to collect together access to past projects and helpful references for the future. 

> [Command Line Interface Simmulator](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/Command-Line-Interface-Sim/)
During my summer placement, I designed and developed an educational Command Line Interface (CLI) training tool built in Unity, drawing on my previous games engineering experience from my BSc. The project was created to support students who are new to CLIs by providing a safe, sandbox-style environment where they can confidently experiment without the risk of damaging real systems or files.
Many students find the transition from familiar graphical interfaces to text-based commands intimidating, and may avoid using the CLI even when it offers greater efficiency. This tool addresses that challenge by offering a guided, low-risk space to learn core concepts interactively—helping users build confidence, improve fluency, and recognise the advantages of command-driven workflows.
Alongside the development of the system, I produced comprehensive project documentation covering the rationale, design structure, technical architecture, and formal testing process, as well as deployment and maintenance guidance. The final product was delivered on time and provides a strong foundation for future enhancements, such as expanded functionality, improved immersion, and broader educational use. 

> [Microsoft HoloLens 2 Development](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/HoloLens2Development.github.io/)
This is a collection of the knowledge I have gained through developing for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 with the Unity Game engine. Through my experience I have found that the community developing for the HoloLens is very small and therefore there are a lot of unanswered questions. This project is a collection of what I have learned made publically available for others to read and contribute to.

> [Setup and Config Files](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/setup-config-files/)
This is a collection of set up and configuration files as starting points for development. For example a .gitignore file to use when creating a Unity project.
